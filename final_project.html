    <h2>concept</h2>
    <p>I wanted to use the LED strip and the remote control to add lights to my dining room that can be easily controlled.</p>
    <p>The remote controls the following features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>power on/off</li>
        <li><bold>fading:</bold> different fading modes (# settings (not including steady))</li>
        <li><bold>adjustable brightness:</bold> manually adjust max brightness</li>
        <li><bold>brightness sensor:</bold> adjusts max brightness automatically based on the current lighting (toggle on/off)</li>
        <li><bold>motion sensor:</bold> turns off lights after a certain amount of time without motion sensed (toggle on/off)</li>
        <li><bold>sound sensor:</bold> turns off lights after a certain amount of time without sound sensed (toggle on/off)</li>
        <li><bold>single leds:</bold> indicates which sensors are on</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>My arduino, breadboard, and sensors are all placed in a box which can be mounted in the corner by the ceiling. The sensors and single LEDs are facing out of the box towards the middle of the room. The 12V power cord is plugged into an outlet in the corner below the box. The LED strip runs across the ceiling of my dining room from the box.</p>
